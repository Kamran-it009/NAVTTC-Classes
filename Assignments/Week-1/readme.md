# **Python Assignment: Learning Variables and Print Statements**

Welcome to your first Python programming assignment! üêç Let's start our coding adventure with some simple and fun tasks. Follow the instructions below and complete each task.

## **Task 1: Printing a Message**

Write a Python program that prints the following message to the screen:

```
Hello, everyone! I am learning Python. üòÑ
```

### **Steps:**

1. Write the code using a `print` statement.
2. Run your code to see the output.

## **Task 2: Declaring Variables**

Create a program that does the following:

1. Declare variables to store:
   - Your **name** (as a string),
   - Your **age** (as an integer), and
   - Your **favorite animal** (as a string).
2. Use `print` statements to display these variables one by one.

### **Example Output:**

```
Name: Sarah
Age: 12
Favorite Animal: Dog
```

---

## **Task 3: Combining Variables in a Message**

Use the variables from **Task 2** to create a single sentence and print it.

### **Example Output:**

```
My name is Sarah, I am 12 years old, and I love dogs!
```

## **Task 4: Playing with Different Data Types**

Write a program that demonstrates three different types of variables:

- A **string** (e.g., your favorite movie),
- An **integer** (e.g., your birth year), and
- A **float** (e.g., the price of your favorite snack).

### **Steps:**

1. Declare three variables, each with a different type.
2. Print each variable on a separate line.

### **Example Output:**

```
Favorite Movie: Toy Story
Birth Year: 2010
Price of Snack: 1.5
```

## **Task 5: Your Favorite Hobby**

1. Create a variable called `hobby` and assign it a value (e.g., `"reading books"`).
2. Write a program that prints the sentence:

   ```
   My favorite hobby is [your hobby].
   ```

   Replace `[your hobby]` with the value of the `hobby` variable.

### **Example Output:**

```
My favorite hobby is reading books.
```

## **Extra Challenge (Optional)**

If you want to explore more, try this bonus task:

1. Create two variables, `a` and `b`, and assign them any numbers you like.
2. Create a third variable, `c`, and assign it the value of `a + b` (no operators, just assignment).
3. Print all three variables.

### **Example Output:**

```
a = 5
b = 7
c = 12 (a and b combined!)
```

## **Submission Guidelines:**

1. **Submission Options:**
   - **Option 1**: Create a Google Colab file (`.ipynb`) and ensure the permissions are set to "Anyone with the link can view." Submit the link in Google Classroom.
   - **Option 2**: Add comments in your code to explain what each part does.
2. **Submission Method:** Submit your completed work through the Google Classroom assignment submission portal.

## **Deadline:**

- **Time:** 11:59 PM on 21/12/2024.
- **Note:** The deadline will **not be extended** under any circumstances. Please plan accordingly.
