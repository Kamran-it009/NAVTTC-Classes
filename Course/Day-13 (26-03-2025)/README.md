# ðŸš€ Async Functions & OOP

### **Synchronous Programming**

**Definition:**  
Synchronous programming refers to the execution model where tasks are performed one after another. Each operation waits for the previous one to complete before starting. This can lead to inefficiencies, especially in I/O-bound tasks.

### **Asynchronous Programming**

**Definition:**  
Asynchronous programming allows tasks to run concurrently, enabling other tasks to continue executing without waiting for others to complete. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound operations like file reading, network requests, or database queries.

**`await` Keyword:**  
The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of an async function until the awaited task is completed. It ensures that asynchronous operations complete before moving to the next line in the function.

## **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

### **Class**

A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. In Python, a class is defined using the `class` keyword.

**Parameters:**
- `__init__(self)`: The constructor method to initialize instance variables.

A **class** defines a blueprint, and an object is created from that blueprint.

### **Object Creation**

An object is an instance of a class. It is created by calling the class as if it were a function, and it can have its own unique properties (instance variables) and behaviors (methods).

An **object** is instantiated from a class, and methods can be called on that object to perform operations.
